Command Chess is a form of Chess that aims to mix up the standard starting positions. By changing the 

## Setup

To start, position the pawns on the front rank of each players' side as in normal chess. 

Next, the white player positions one piece of their choice anywhere on the second rank of their side.

The black players follows by positioning any two pieces on their back rank.

White then positions two of their pieces.

This continues until black has no pieces left to position. White then places their final piece.

Play then starts as usual.

## Castling

Castling still applies as in standard chess, however, with the flexibility of piece positioning the rules for castling must be made more general.

To castle: 

- both the King and the rook to be castled must not have moved all game.
- The spaces between the King and the rook must be clear of any pieces.
- The spaces between the king and rook must not be in the line of attack by any enemy pieces

Castling:

1. Swap the position of the king and rook
2. Center the pieces in the area where the castling took place
3. If they are not able to be centered due to an even number of spaces, round the pieces toward the center of the board
