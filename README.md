# Command Chess

## Summary

Command Chess is a form of chess that mixes up the standard game. By allowing players to position their back row, Command Chess adds another layer of strategy to chess.

## Positioning

1. Position the pawns on the front row of each players' side as in normal chess. 
2. The white player positions one piece of their choice anywhere on the second rank of their side.
3. The black players follows by positioning any two pieces on their back rank.
4. White then positions two of their pieces.
5. This continues until black has no pieces left to position. White then places their final piece.
6. Play then starts as usual.

### Double placement

Double placement of pieces beyond white's first placement is meant to balance the first player advantage that white usually enjoys in chess. Placing two pieces second is advantageous for the black player because their placement may counter the first placement of white.

## Castling

Castling still applies as in standard chess, however, with the flexibility of piece positioning the rules for castling must be made more general.

### Requirements of castling

- Both the King and the rook to be castled must not have moved all game.
- The spaces between the King and the rook must be clear of any pieces.
- The spaces between the king and rook must not be in the line of attack of any enemy pieces

### How to castle

1. Swap the position of the king and rook
2. Move the king and rook toward each other so that each piece moves an equal distance, stopping when the pieces are adjacent or one space apart
3. If there ends up being one space in between the king and rook, than the rook moves into the empty space

## Bishops

In this chess variant, the bishops may end up occupying the same color spaces.
