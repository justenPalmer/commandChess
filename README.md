# Command Chess

## Summary

Command Chess is a form of chess that mixes up the standard game. By allowing players to position their back row, Command Chess adds another layer of strategy to chess.

## Positioning

In Command Chess the positioning of the pieces is determined before the game starts. Players take turns placing their pieces until they have completed their back row.

1. Position the pawns on the front row of each players' side as in normal chess. 
2. The white player positions one piece of their choice anywhere on the back row of their side.
3. The black player follows by positioning any two pieces on their back row.
4. White then positions two pieces.
5. Each player continues placing two pieces until black has no pieces left. White then places their final piece.
6. Play then starts as usual with white moving first.

### Double placement

Double placement of pieces beyond white's first placement is meant to balance the first player advantage that white usually enjoys in chess. Placing two pieces second is advantageous for the black player because their placement may counter the first placement of white.

## Castling

Castling still applies as in standard chess, however, with the flexibility of piece positioning the rules for castling must be made more general.

### Requirements of castling

- Both the king and the rook to be castled must not have moved all game.
- The spaces between the king and the rook must be clear of any pieces.
- The spaces between the king and rook must not be in the line of attack of any enemy piece.

### How to castle

1. Swap the position of the king and rook.
2. Move the king and rook toward each other so that each piece moves an equal distance, stopping when the pieces are adjacent or one space apart.
3. If there ends up being one space in between the king and rook, than the king moves into the empty space.

## Bishops

In this chess variant, bishops may end up occupying the same color spaces. This is intended, as it may create a strategic "blitz" on a color of spaces on the board. However, this may create an optimal strategy that may prove too powerful. Playtesting and simulation may determine whether an additional rule about distinct bishop color placement is required.
